"Wake up! Wake up!" said the Dog, the Cat, the Pig, and the Hen. "I will," said the Little Old Woman. "I will get out of bed and make a big pancake." She made a pancake with a face of gumdrops. 

All of a sudden, the pancake man jumped off the plate. The woman ran after him. He waved and said, "Run, run as fast as you can! You can't catch me, I'm the Pancake Man!" 

The Dog and the Cat sat in the shade. The Pancake Man came up to them. "Stop! We want to taste that pancake," they said. "Too late," said the Pancake Man. "I ran from the Little Old Woman and I can run from you. I can!" <q(f) Whom did the pancake man run from? /q> <h whom made the pancake man? /h> <a little old woman /a>

Then the Pancake Man met the Pig. "I will take you back to the Little Old Woman," the Pig said. "Then shake a leg," said the Pancake Man. "I ran from the Little Old Woman, the Dog, and the Cat, and I can run from you. I can!" 

The Hen was on the gate when the Pancake Man came by. "Shame on you," said the Hen. "Look at all the fuss! I will get you!" "No! I ran from the Little Old Woman, the Dog, the Cat, and the Pig, and I can run from you. I can!" said the Pancake Man. 

The Pancake Man then ran to a lake. A Fox came up to him and said, "Don't get wet! I will take you. Jump on." Out on the lake, the Fox said, "Now jump on my nose!" The Pancake Man did. Was this a mistake? 

No! The Fox had a picnic set up. "Am I about to be your lunch?" asked the Pancake Man. "I don't like pancakes," said the Fox. "But I do like grape jam sandwiches." So they ate and ate. This is the end of the tale, but not the end of the Pancake Man! <q(e) How did the Pancake Man feel when the fox said she doesn't like pancakes? /q> <h The Pancake Man doesn't have to be eaten! /h> <a positive;happy;relieved /a>
