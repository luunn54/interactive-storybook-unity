Freda liked to play pretend. She really loved to play school. She was always the teacher -- just like Miss Cathy. 

"Sit in a circle," she told her dolls. "No running. No shouting," she told her robots. 

"Quiet for story time," she told her bears. 

Soon Percy came over. He liked playing school. "I'm the teacher," said Freda. "Okay," said Percy. "But I want to be the teacher sometime, too." 

"For now you're a student," said Freda. "Lie down. Rest time." "Miss Cathy always says 'Please lie down'" said Percy. "She told us that it's polite to say 'please' when you ask for something." 

"I'm the teacher!" said Freda. "I can do what I want." "You're being bossy," said Percy. "Miss Cathy is always polite." 

Percy walked away and began to play by himself. <q(e) How did Percy feel? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at the picture. How does Percy look? Can you show me with your face? /h><a negative /a>

"Line up for recess," Freda told her bears. She wished Percy would line up, too.

Freda walked over to Percy. "Please line up," she said. "Well, okay," said Percy. "I will--since you said 'please.'" 

Emma saw Freda and Percy come outside. She and her dog, Pickle, wanted to play. "Can we join your class?" Emma asked. 

"Sure," said Freda. "Line up behind Percy." "What happened to 'please'?" asked Percy. "Please," said Freda. <q(f) Who wanted to join Freda and Percy outside? /q><h Look at the picture. Do you see a dog and a girl waving? /h><a Emma;Pickle /a>

"Remember that I wanted to be the teacher, too," said Percy. "You can be the recess teacher," said Freda. "Thank you," said Percy. "Miss Cathy said it's polite to say 'thank you' when someone does something nice for you."

Percy said, "Okay. Now that I'm the teacher, I say, let's play ball!" He gave the ball to Freda. "Thank you," she said. <q(f) What game did everyone play at recess? /q><h Look at the picture. What are they playing? /h><a Ball. /a>

"I know what Miss Cathy says when someone says 'thank you,'" Emma said. "You're welcome." 

"Pass the ball to Percy, please," said Emma. Freda tossed the ball high in the air. Percy ran and caught it. "Thank you!" Percy called out. 

Freda laughed. "You're welcome," she said.
