"I'll stay with your baby girl," the grandmother said to the little girl's mother. "I am not a baby," the girl said. "I am a very big kid." 

Then she asked her mom if she could go and play with her friends. Her mother just gave her a look. <q(i) Did the girl's mother want her to go and play with her friends? /q> <h What does it mean when your mother gives you a look? /h> <a No /a> 

When the little girl turned on the TV, her Gram said, "Let's not look at TV. Would you like to find a book we can read together?" 

After reading for a while, Gram asked the little girl, "Shall I stop now?" "No, don't stop. Do you mind?" the little girl said. Gram did not mind at all. 

When it was time for lunch, Gram made two sandwiches and some fresh lemonade. Then she cut an apple in half. 

"Before we eat, you must find a star in your lunch," Gram told the little girl. "There are no stars out now. It's daytime!" the girl said. "Just look," said Gram. 

First, the girl looked in the glass of lemonade. Next, she looked inside her sandwich. She could not find a star. 

Then Gram held up the apple and showed her the star. "See, it was there all the time," she said. 

"Now let's be a little wild and eat our lunch outside," said Gram. They took their lunch and went out the back door. "Lunch tastes good outside!" the little girl said. They sang songs. The little girl told Gram jokes. Gram said the jokes were funny. Then they played Go Fish. <q(f) What did Gram and the little girl play? /q> <h What is the girl holding in her hand? /h> <a Go Fish;card;cards /a> 

"I had a very nice time with you. I love you Gram," the little girl said with a smile. 

"When can you come back?" she asked Gram. Gram said she would be back soon. 

Gram gave the little girl a kiss. The little girl gave Gram a hug. "I know you would like to play with your friends," Gram said. "It means a lot to me that you are here with your old Gram. You are a kind child."
