There once was a dog. "I am too weak to work. My mom does not need me," he said. 

"I will go to town to beat the drums," Dog said. "There I will be needed." So he ran down the street. 

Who did he meet? Dog met a sheep. "I am too weak to work. My man does not need me," she said. 

"Come to town," said Dog. "I will beat and you can bleat. There we will be needed." So they ran down the street. 

Who did they meet? Dog and Sheep met a cat. "I am too weak to work. My woman does not need me," he said. 

"Come to town," said Sheep. "I will bleat and you can tap your feet. There we will be needed." So they ran down the street. 

Who did they meet? Dog, Sheep, and Cat met a bird. "I am too weak to work. My man does not need me," she said. 

"Come to town," said Cat. "I will tap my feet and you can tweet. There we will be needed." So they ran down the street. <q(i) What will the dog, sheep, cat, and the bird do together? /q> <h What can they do? /h> <a play music;tweet;beat;bleat;tap /a>

"I need meat," Dog said. "The heat!" Sheep said. 

"I need sleep," Cat said. "I need a seat," Bird said. 

"I see a hut!" Cat said. So Dog, Sheep, Cat, and Bird went to peek in the hut. 

There were mean men in the hut who liked to steal. They were eating a big meal. "Let's trick them," said Dog. 

So Dog beat the drums. Sheep went "bleat." Cat tapped his feet. Bird made a "tweet." "Let's leave!" said the men. <q(e) How did the mean men feel when he heard the sounds? /q> <h Why did the men run away? /h> <a scared;frightened;negative /a> 

So Dog, Sheep, Cat, and Bird went in. Now they can sleep, eat, and keep their beat in their band.
