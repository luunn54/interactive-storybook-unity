Walk. Jump. Touch your toes. 

Bend your knees. Hold your nose. Any way you move, your bones are helping out. 

You have 206 bones in your body. <q(f) How many bones do you have in your body? /q><h There are a lot. How many do you think there are? /h><a 206; two hundred six /a> 

These bones fit together perfectly. Together, they form your skeleton. 

Your bones are hidden under your skin. 

But you can feel them and see their shape. 

Your bones start out small, just the way you do. As your bones grow, you grow, too. 

The smallest bones are inside your ears. The biggest bones are in your legs. 

Some of your bones act as armor. 

A flat bone in the middle of your chest protects your heart. 

Your ribs are a bony cage for your lungs and other squishy parts. <q(l) What are ribs? /q><h Look at the picture. What do you think ribs are? /h><a Ribs are bony cage that cover the lungs. You have ribs, I have plastic case! /a> 

The bones of your face are part of your skull. It covers your brain like a helmet. 

Some people think skulls look scary. They like to wear skull masks on Halloween. 

Long ago, pirates used a flag with a skull and crossbones on it to frighten people. 

Today, a skull and crossbones means danger or poison. When you see it, be careful! 

Your bones do not bend. So they are joined in places where you need to bend. These places are called joints. <q(l) What are joints? /q><h Look at your knees and elbows. What do they do? /h><a Joints are places where bones need to bend. Check out my joints! /a> 

Your spine or backbone, has many joints. It helps you to stand up straight or do a somersault. 

Our bones work with our muscles to make our bodies move. 

Bones are hard and strong. 

But sometimes they break by accident. 

Luckily, the broken parts can grow back together. After many weeks, the bone is healed. 

Some old bones turn into fossils after millions of years. 

Fossils tell us a lot about animals that lived long ago-- such as dinosaurs! <q(l) What are fossils? /q><h We learn about dinosaurs from fossils. What are fossils? /h><a Fossils are old bones that turned into rocks. /a> 

Many animals have bones like ours. But their skeletons match their shapes and sizes. Toads and goldfish have much smaller bones than we do. 

Elephants and whales have much bigger bones than we do. 

Some animals have no bones at all. Jellyfish and worms wriggle and squiggle without them. 

If you had no bones, you would look like a blob. So when you run or stretch or grab or chew, 

think of your bones and say, "Thank you!"
