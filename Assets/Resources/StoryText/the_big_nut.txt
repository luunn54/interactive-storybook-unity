A van went by. BUMP! "Quack! Quack!" said Duck. "Stop! Stop!" Pig and Pup ran out. "What is up, Duck?" they said. 

"That van hit a rut," said Duck. "This big nut fell out. Would you help me? Let's get it into the hut." <q(f) why did the big nut fall out? /q> <h What hit the nut? /h> <a van;car;hit /a> 

"What a big nut!" said Pig. "How will we get it into the hut?" "Quack! Quack!" said Duck. "We can use my quilt as a sack." 

"This is a big nut!" said Pup. "What will you do with it?" "I'll crack it in two," Duck said. "How?" said Pup. 

Duck put his quilt on the nut. "How will I crack it? I'll sit and sit," said Duck. "Quack!" said Duck. "I can't crack it." "Do not quit!" said Pup. 

"Quack! Quack! I'll hit the nut. I'll get this nut to crack," said Duck. "Quack!" said Duck. "I can't crack it." "Do not quit!" said Pig. 

"I'll hop, hop, hop. I'll get this nut to pop," said Duck. "Quack!" said Duck. "I can't crack it." "Do not quit!" said Pig and Pup. 

"Quack! Quack! Quack!" said Duck. "This nut will not crack. Not when I hop or hit. Not when I sit and sit." "Do not quit!" said Pup and Pig. 

"I'll cut this nut with my bill," said Duck. "Yes, I will." "What bad luck. My bill is stuck! Quick! Call the vet!" Pig said, "You bet!" 

"Would you come see Duck? Quick!" said Pig. "Is Duck sick?" said the vet. "No," said Pig. "Duck is not ill. But his bill is stuck in a nut!" 

The vet ran into the hut. "Tut-tut!" she said. "What a nut!" She put a hand in her vest. "I'll use these," said the vet. "I will yank out your bill." 

"Now I'll crack the nut," said the vet. "How?" said Duck. "This is how," said the vet. 

The vet went up to the top. She sent the nut down. The nut hit a big rock. Crack! "What a doc!" said Duck. "Quack! What is in that nut?" 

"Milk," said the vet. "Would you like some?" "We would," said Pig, Pup, and Duck. So they all went into the hut. They all drank from the nut! <q(i) What was in the nut? /q> <h What are they drinking? /h> <a Milk /a>
